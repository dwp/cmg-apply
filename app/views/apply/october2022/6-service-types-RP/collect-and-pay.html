                    We may be able to collect payments from the other parent and pass them on to you. This is called 'Collect and Pay'. Both parents will be charged if you use Collect and Pay.

                <p>We have to ask the other parent how they want to pay. You can only start with a Collect and Pay arrangement if the other parent:</p>

                      <li>refuses to respond to us

                      <li>agrees to use Collect and Pay

                        <li>work out how much the payment will be and tell both parents

                        <li>collect payments from the other parent and pass them on to you – there are charges for this

                    <!-- Charges for using Collect and Pay -->
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Charges for using Collect and Pay</h3>
  <p>You and the other parent will both be charged fees if you use Collect and Pay. <br/> <br/>
   
When you get paid child maintenance, 4% will be taken from each payment. When the other parent pays child maintenance, 20% is added to each payment.

<br/> <br/>
If the payment amount was £100, you would get £96 and the other parent would pay £120. <br/> <br/>
