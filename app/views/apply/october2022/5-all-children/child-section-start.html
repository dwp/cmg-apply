                <p>To calculate your maintenance properly, we need to get some information about your children. </p>
                <p>First, we need to know about the child or children you’re applying to include in this maintenance arrangement. </p>

               

                <p>Then we also need to know if you have any other children who you pay maintenance for, if it’s a private arrangement (not using Child Maintenance Service). </p>
                <p>Finally, we need to know if any other children live with you the majority of the time (like a partner’s children).</p>
                <p>We’ll ask about one child at a time, and you can keep adding children to your application until you have added them all. </p>
                <p>All children must be under the age of 20.</p>
