                <p>We can collect payments from you and pass them on to the other parent. This is called ‘Collect and Pay’. Both parents will be charged if you use Collect and Pay.

                <p>You can only choose to start with a Collect and Pay arrangement if the other parent agrees to it.  <br/><br/>

                  Collect and Pay can also be enforced if you:</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Charges for using Collect and Pay</h3>
  <p>You and the other parent will both be charged fees if you use Collect and Pay. <br/> <br/>
    When you pay child maintenance, 20% is added to each payment. When the other parent gets paid child maintenance, 4% will be taken from each payment. <br/> <br/>
    If the payment amount was £100, you would pay £120 and the other parent would get £96. <br/> <br/>
